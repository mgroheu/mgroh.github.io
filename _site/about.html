<p><em>Trilingual Business Leader (German, Russian, English) with 15+ years’ demonstrated success increasing market share and earnings, reducing costs, and improving client satisfaction in Europe, Russia, Middle East.</em></p>

<p>My years of experience in the business sector have taught me some extremely crucial lessons. Perhaps the most important is that companies need to be flexible. Flexibility in the corporate world is not just an abstract concept, but rather a necessary reality. To this end, I myself have experienced and worked in just about every aspect of the business world there is. Beginning with my tenure as a sales manager in the consumer industry, I came to understand all facets of the company, from finances, to budget planning, to recruiting on the human resource end of things; I learned the true value of being flexible.</p>

<p>I’ve spent a great deal of time internationally in sales, marketing management as well as procurement / category management. However, the one area with which I have extensive experience and thus, within which I am deeply invested, is the role of the business leader. Having worked as a director for both retail and e-commerce companies, I came to familiarize myself with the structures that were vital to a business’s livelihood. The thing about these structures however is that they are ever changing. The old adage about the only constant being change, particularly rings true in the corporate world. Problem solving, negotiating, realigning, researching and innovating are at the core of management’s role. I learned this time and time again. I strive to impart this wisdom to every company and executive with whom I consult.</p>

<p>Since 2020, I have been an adjunct lecturer at Reutlingen University. I currently teach courses in Digital Marketing, Advanced Digital Marketing, Marketing  &amp; E-Commerce Management. I also teach the Marketing course in MBA Program.</p>

<p>
I love teaching because it allows me to connect with the students and truly mentor them. Class sizes allow me to know all my students by name (as long as my memory holds out) and get to know their strengths so I can teach more effectively. I enjoy watching students make connections—when the light bulb goes off; it's great to see! I also understand that students today are juggling many different priorities, and it's important for them to be able to connect with someone in their chosen field of study. There is no better way to learn than by doing. It's hard, chaotic and messy. But, when you get through it, you can look back and realise that you have actually learned something. That's what makes teaching and learning at Reutlingen University a meaningful experience.</p>
<p>
My role as a faculty advisor is one of the most challenging aspects of my job—and the one that I find most rewarding. Students seem to appreciate being able to come and talk about both challenges and successes and get advice from me about careers, internships and opportunities that come up outside of the classroom.</p>
<p>
I have a PhD in Business Administration <strong>(major: Marketing and Strategy)</strong> from the University of Minho, where my dissertation research addressed the gap which exists in e-commerce business portfolio literature by evaluating the effectiveness of product policies employed by e-commerce companies. The analysis identified the theoretical institutions that define e-commerce companies and how firms can maximise profits with selected factors that reduce their transaction costs.</p>

<h4 class="title">EXCERPT FROM RECOMMENDATIONS</h4>

<p><strong>Igor Tarasenko, Chief Digital Officer (CDO) at SEPHORA</strong></p>
<blockquote>
While working with Maximilian at SOKOLOV I was impressed with his detailed attitude to business as to global strategy planning and operations including those who need quick and smart decisions. Max represents a top level for business leading and careful team management.
</blockquote> 

<p><strong>Gary Rogers, Retail Regional Manager at Barratt Homes</strong></p>
<blockquote>
I know Max through our time together at Apple. From the moment I met him, I was impressed with his positive attitude, his creativity and his drive for solutions.<br />Max is natural leader who is not afraid to try different approaches to get the results required. His adaptability, as well as his analytical style, enables him to produce consistent results in all areas.<br />Aligned with these traits, Max’s people focus is at the centre of all his work; whether that be developing his own teams or delivering great customer satisfaction at every opportunity.<br />I would highly recommend Max for any role, particularly in Sales, Operations, Business Development and Retail Leadership.
</blockquote> 

<p><strong>Uwe Best, Manager at Apple</strong></p>
<blockquote>
Max is a gifted leader who draws his strength and effectiveness from excellent communication skills in different languages and an aura of unquestioned integrity. Whether interacting one-on-one or in front of a large group, and no matter the audience, Max projects a sense of excitement, inclusion and straight talk that inspires his people to rise to the occasion time and again without fail. He leads by example and is a model for leaders that practice Servant Leadership. He is inspiring, intelligent, humorous, grounded and able to focus on the big picture in times of uncertainty. Max is one of the most outstanding leaders I have ever worked with. Max is also skilled at mobilizing his team to identify and take ownership of significant objectives that will drive the business forward, producing a results-driven environment of entrepreneurship and accountability. During the time I worked directly with Max I saw him take immediate control of one of the most challenging retail markets in München. Max is very passionate about his work and quickly gains respect at all levels. He made a point to take the time to make personal connections. I feel privileged to have had the opportunity to learn from him.
