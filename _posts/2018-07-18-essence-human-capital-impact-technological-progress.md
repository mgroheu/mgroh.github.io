Technological progress represents a development in technology that is greater than scientific understanding. In this case, technology comprises of all kinds of knowledge, from undemanding and routine processes to techniques of business and supervision, from apparatus primarily requiring several blue-collar employees, to sophisticated scientific inquiry which create innovations and goods. Technological progress is the centre of industrialization as well as economic growth. Numerous aspects are influencing the economic development including resource allocation, economies of scale and level of education.

Manufacturing sector lacks the necessary planning in scientific investigations and technical progress. In technological progress, many governments rely on external expertise rather than promoting the development of local human capital. Currently, the main achievement of technological development takes place due to thorough R&amp;D done by private sectors and also governments. Momentous and continued attempts in R&amp;D, together with the technical arrangement, are the significant components of technological progress and competitiveness.

Apart from generating information, investing in R&amp;D can be the basis of developing technological ability that permits speedy acquisition and information dissemination. Macro-economic proof demonstrates that human capital contributes to economic development. Both social and fiscal proceeds of human capital are necessary, just like physical capital as such economic indexes integrate a series of information associated with abilities, training and level of education.

Human capital has been widely used to demonstrate the economic effect. Besides, human capital is used in technological development as a primary indicator to describe economic increase, making it an aspect that increases the efficiency of labour and balances capital growth simultaneously. However, technological development ought to be stable for a given phase of evaluation, excluding the likelihoods of increasing the rate of creativity or a realistic decreasing of creativity.

Economic theories increase the accumulation of human capital, leading to endogenous economic development models which adequately describe the association between economic increase and technological progress. Even though technological progress is mostly deployed for the aim of replacing labour aspect, there are exceptional complements of human capital, though its econometrically intricate to establish. The entertainment ability of technology makes it disapprovingly rebound in the increase of productivity.

Investments in R&amp;D are related to innovations, though loosely since the quantity of investment never depicts the quality of creativity. Product brands evaluate the production of new products as well as services in the market, or changes in the marketing penetration strategies for old goods and hence demonstrates a more instant effect on output.

Nonetheless, business innovation includes more than these indicators. Companies in Australia implementing improvement are probable to devote to acquiring new tools, marketing and training instead of investing in research and development. Studies on improvements in the United States, European Union and Japan reported that companies believe that patents are insignificant compare to other ways of appropriating their funds in improvement. Recognizing these aspects, the speed of creativity in developed economies indeed seems to reduce in 2000, although declines are not evident for the 80s or 90s. Copyright applications, brands and business-sponsored research and development in developed nations also reduced in the 2000s.
Nevertheless, in Australia, patents and business sponsored R&amp;D continued to be more durable. This shows the impacts of product boom and stable income during that period. Primary as well as resource-based sectors cover a more significant percentage of business investment in R&amp;D and are vital drives in the growth in recent times.

It becomes imperative that human capital is an essential element of state-run economic competitiveness as indicated from a wide range of statistical reviews. What is apparent is that the more a nation develops, the more they need for human capital and technological advancement, to enhance competitiveness. For instance, more than twenty-four per cent of the 2007-2008 WEF competitiveness level of developed economies and more than sixteen per cent of the level of underdeveloped nations relate to human capital benchmarks. Modelling demonstrates that nations which are ranked highly can have a competitive edge, mainly when they carry our reforms that aim at enhancing human capital. However, these same nations should ensure they maintain and continue to upgrade their human capital and modern technology to remain competitive.

The effect of global novelty is not likely to be instantaneous, since for innovations to be rehabilitated to fabrication methods, which should be embraced by several businesses or persons to impact country output performance in a substantial way. Dwindling novelty is all about phases that witness both slow and fast growth globally leading to a development apex in the mid-twentieth century and a turn down ever since. 

It is nevertheless argued that prospects lack for enhancing the pace which the global front line moves in the way that previous industrial renaissance has. However, the truth is that some of the probable explanations for synchronized economy productivity output turn downs consist a plummeting pace of innovation, the vanishing effect of breakthroughs in ICT and the disappearing effect of previous economic reforms and perhaps shifting production sectors.
