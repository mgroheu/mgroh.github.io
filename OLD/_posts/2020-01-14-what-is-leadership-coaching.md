The coaching process is based on the preconditions of human development and self-development. Intrinsically, every person is outstandingly talented and has enormous potential, which is not reached by the person to the full extent. Potentially, every subject contains answers to nearly all questions as well as possible solutions for evolving problems. Coach does not offer out-of-the-box advice or recommendation but helps a manager to find his solutions for the most relevant issues.

Interactive communication, polylogue and discussion are the basic concepts of leadership coaching as a technology. The direct, perceptible and immediate result becomes an advantage of coaching in the process of improvement of emotional quotient (EQ). It is qualified as an intermediate result; however, it is crucial for training of specialists since it creates the motivational basis required for further professional and personal development.

Special requirements are imposed on the coach in the coaching process:
<ul>
<li>objectivation of issues dealt with during the process of interaction with a trainee;</li>
<li>establishment of trust-based and partnership (equitable) relations which enable to remove barriers in the course of interaction and to facilitate the process of solving of problems which face a future specialist;</li>
<li>experience and professional competence of the coach shall produce a synergetic effect on a manager.</li>
</ul>

Having the merits of the allied technologies which are borrowed from psychology and management, coaching determines positive development pathways in reliance on the attitude of personal fulfilment and self-fulfilment of a student.

My recommendations on the implementation of leadership coaching for the purpose of achieving of EQ of the future leader are as follows:
<ol>
<li>To define tasks and objectives (setting of benchmarks and priorities);</li>
<li>To look into the current situation (identifying of available resources and limitations); the coach tries to understand the current situation (problem), asking questions and listening attentively; the student analyzes the situation and his attitude towards it together with the coach.</li>
<li>To identify internal and external obstacles to obtaining of the result: the coach tries to understand what prevents the manager from achieving of the objective and from helping him in realizing and analyzing of the obstacles; the manager reviews his internal and external obstacles.</li>
<li>To work out and analyze the possibilities for clearing of the obstacles: the coach asks questions and uses other techniques provoking the manager into the finding of solutions and overcoming of constraints; the manager reviews the possibilities for clearing of the obstacles.</li>
<li>To select a specific alternative scenario and to make a plan: the coach helps the manager in analyzing of the possibilities; the manager reviews the possibilities selects a specific alternative and makes an action plan. The coach and the manager agree on what exactly shall be done by the next meeting (by a specified date).</li>
</ol>

The following components of professional training of a specialist are the main aspects for the implementation of coaching: objective, tasks, contents, technologies and result. During the introductory training session, besides the objective set by the coach, processes of self-planning and planning of the manager's work are initiated, thus establishing the required level of involvement of the subject in the process of structuring of the coaching course.

Appraisal of the results is an essential element of control of success of the trainee exercised by the coach.
